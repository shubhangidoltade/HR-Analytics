## Overall Observation:

• The analysis reveals that employee attrition is strongly influenced by tenure, job satisfaction, salary, and work-life balance.

• Employees with less tenure and low job satisfaction are more likely to leave, indicating a need for stronger onboarding, mentorship, and better employee engagement strategies.

• Salary disparities, particularly among lower salary slabs, contribute to higher attrition. Addressing compensation structures and offering pay raises could help retain valuable talent.

• Poor work-life balance and excessive overtime are key drivers of attrition. Promoting flexible work hours and reducing overtime would likely improve retention.

• Career development opportunities and promotions are crucial for employee retention, as employees who have not been promoted in several years show higher attrition.

• Gender-based trends suggest that different retention strategies may be required for male and female employees.

By implementing targeted strategies based on these findings, organizations can enhance employee retention, satisfaction, and overall workforce stability.

This HR analytics report provides valuable insights for HR leaders and decision-makers to understand the causes behind employee attrition and take proactive measures to foster a more stable, satisfied, and engaged workforce.
